## Introduction

Financial Analysis is a mind bending (and fun!) subject to study, learn, read, and apply. During the summer 2019 an idea came to mind to learn R Shiny. And I had a project that fitted quite well: create an interactive dashboard from a stock analysis checklist.

Harry Domash is the mastermind behind dividenddetective.com. A section on this website refers you to his site 'Winning Investing' ("http://www.winninginvesting.com"). There is where I found the "stock analysis checklist", which is the basis of this interactive dashboard. 

The checklist has two sections. One, a basic research section with 8 areas. Two, an advanced research section with 4 areas.

To access this interactive dashboard, click on the tab panel named "Research". Have a stock symbol to mind: I hope you enjoy this project!

Note: The dashboard is a personal project, to be used for information purposes only.  It is not intended to be investment advice. Please seek a duly licensed professional for investment advice.

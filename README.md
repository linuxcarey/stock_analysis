## Stock Analysis Checklist - A Shiny Interactive Dashboard

This interactive dashboard is a personal project, to be used for information purposes only.  It is not intended to be investment advice. Please seek a duly licensed professional for investment advice.

This interactive dashboard refers to the site 'Winning Investing' ("http://www.winninginvesting.com"). You'll find the section "stock analysis checklist", which is the basis of this dashboard.

The checklist has two sections. One, a basic research section with 8 areas. Two, an advanced research section with 4 areas.

To access this dashboard, click on the tab panel named "Research". Have a stock symbol to mind: I hope you enjoy this project!

Grateful to the R community people, may it be the R Core Team, R Studio Team, users from the tens of posts from Rstudio community and Stackoverflow.
